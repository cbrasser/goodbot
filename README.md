# goodbot

Unfinished Discord bot that does basic user handling with levels and points and some specific stuff for the game fortnite BR. And he is also a very good Boy!

The bot includes:
- a basic leveling/points system for the users of your discord server
- A lot of functionality around the game fortnite battle royale, mainly a database where you can store/query wins including the mode,
the involved players and the amount of kills. You can also store sniper kills with the distance an a video url as "evidence". Naturally the bot can give you the longest kill and it's video via command.
- You can write your own "SELECT" query on the database (theres a command for the schema)
- You can get dank memes en mass
- There's a command to get quick facts about a search term from urban dictionary (Special thanks to SilvoSposetti)
- (Still in development) Get your player stats from fortnitetracker via command directly into discord
- Pet the good boy to thank him for his services
 
 To get this running you need node.js installed, as well as discord.js and sqlite (both via node), and the token you get from the discord dev page.
