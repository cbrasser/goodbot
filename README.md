# goodbot

Work-in-progress Discord bot that does basic user handling with levels and points and some specific stuff for the game fortnite BR. And he is also a very good Boy!

The bot includes:
- a basic leveling/points system for the users of your discord server
- A lot of functionality around the game fortnite battle royale, mainly a database where you can store/query wins including the mode,
the involved players and the amount of kills. You can also store sniper kills with the distance an a video url as "evidence". Naturally the bot can give you the longest kill and it's video via command.
- You can write your own "SELECT" query on the database (theres a command for the schema)
- You can get dank memes en mass
- There's a command to get quick facts about a search term from urban dictionary (Special thanks to SilvoSposetti)
- (Still in development) Get your player stats from fortnitetracker via command directly into discord
- Pet the good boy to thank him for his services
- Lots of fun stuff for small to medium sized discord servers where you know most of the people (There is no cooldown for most commands and they *could* be abused, so make sure thats why I atm suggest to only use it on private servers if you wish so) 
 
 To get this running you need node.js installed, as well as discord.js and sqlite (both via node), and the token you get from the discord dev page.

You can also invite the bot into your discord guild directly via: 
https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=407559485373284353&permissions=452672&scope=bot

Be aware that the bot is hosted on a free hoster and might be down from time to time.

If you are using parts of my code, I'd highly appreciate if you'd mention it, thanks :)
