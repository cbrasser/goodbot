# goodbot

Unfinished Discord bot that does basic user handling with levels and points and some specific stuff for the game fortnite BR.

Up until now you can:
 - Store wins with the amount of kills and players
 - Get the highest kill win for all game modes
 - store snipes with distances
 - get the longest distance snipe
 - Most importantly: Pet the Dog
 
 To get this running you need node.js installed, as well as discord.js and sqlite (both via node), and the token you get from the discord dev page.
